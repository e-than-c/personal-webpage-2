          <h2>Role</h2>
          <p>
            As a full-stack developer, I designed and developed both the
            frontend and backend of the application. I worked closely with the
            design team using Figma to implement UI/UX best practices, while
            also collaborating with the backend team for integration. I
            implemented key features such as the search bar, login
            authentication, third-party authentication, friends list, and user
            profile.
          </p>

        <div class="reflection">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The development of FitBook was an invaluable learning experience, as
            it was my first major developer project. The key lesson I took away,
            more than any other technical skill, was the importance of clear and
            concise communication within a team. Collaborating with others
            taught me how to effectively share ideas, give and receive feedback,
            and ensure that everyone was aligned and on the same page throughout
            the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was also my first time implementing the Agile methodology in
            practice, which helped streamline our workflow and improve
            efficiency as we developed more features. I had the opportunity to
            work with technologies like MongoDB and React Native, both of which
            were new to me at the time. Diving into these tools expanded my
            technical skill set and taught me to adapt quickly to unfamiliar
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this project sharpened my collaboration, problem-solving,
            and teamwork abilities, while reinforcing my passion for learning
            new technologies. It also gave me a strong foundation in full-stack
            development and cross-platform app creation, which I now carry
            forward into future projects.
